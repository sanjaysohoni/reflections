Question: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Reflection: when I am collaborating with others or I want to publish my work for others to use or for future collaboration

Question: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Reflection: when there are other contributors, I want to make sure that I can only pull changes that will not disrupt the work I am doing at that time
